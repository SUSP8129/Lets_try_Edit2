    <h1>Let's Try Edit2 - Text Editor</h1>

        <h2 class="one">1. What is "Edit2"?</h2>
            <p>"Edit2" is a browser-based text editor created by RasPython3.</p>
            <p>
                The developer, RasPython3, told me that the idea was to create a simple text editor 
                for Chromebook development because there were no easy-to-use text editors available.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, he continued to make improvements, and the current version was created.
            </p>
            <p>
                This text editor is still being improved, and further evolution is expected.
            </p>
            <p>For more information about RasPython3, click on "Menu" at the top of this page and jump to "About".</p>
